## Loss Relief Options

Your company has a trading loss of **£681.18** available for relief. You have the following options:

### Option 1: Carry Forward (Recommended)

- **Carry the loss forward** to offset against future trading profits
- Can be used against profits from either food delivery or IT consultancy activities
- No time limit on usage
- Most flexible option for a startup company

**Example:** If you make £5,000 profit next year:
- Taxable profit: £5,000 - £681.18 = £4,318.82
- Corporation tax saving: £681.18 × 19% = **£129.42 saved**

### Option 2: Carry Back

- Carry back to previous accounting period (if you had one with profits)
- Not applicable if this is your first trading year
- Limited to 12 months carry back

**Recommendation:** **Carry forward** - retain the loss to offset future profits when your trading bot generates revenue or food delivery scales up.

## Director's Remuneration Analysis

**Question Addressed:** Should directors have paid themselves a salary?

**For Tax Year 2024/25:**

**Current Position (No Salary Paid):**
- ✅ No salary expense claimed
- ✅ No Income Tax or National Insurance due personally
- ✅ No Employer's National Insurance due from company
- ✅ Simpler compliance
- ⚠️ No National Insurance credits earned (may affect state pension)

**If Salary Had Been Paid (£34 to match revenue):**
- Company expense: £34.00 (increases loss to £715.18)
- Employer's NI (13.8% on earnings above £9,100): ~£0.00 (below threshold)
- Personal Income Tax: £0.00 (within personal allowance)
- Employee's NI: £0.00 (below threshold)
- **Net result:** Slightly larger loss, no material benefit

**Verdict:** Not paying salary was the correct decision given the minimal revenue and overall loss position.

---

## Future Tax Planning Recommendations

### 1. Salary Strategy for Profitable Years

When the company becomes profitable, consider:

**Tax-Efficient Salary Level:**
- Pay each director £9,100-£12,570 per year
- Falls within personal allowance (£12,570 for 2024/25)
- No Income Tax
- Minimal National Insurance
- Builds NI credits for state pension
- Tax-deductible expense for company

**Example:** Two directors, £9,100 each = £18,200 annual salary expense

### 2. Dividend Strategy

Once profitable and after paying salaries:
- Distribute remaining profits as dividends
- First £500 dividend allowance is tax-free (2024/25)
- Basic rate taxpayers pay 8.75% on dividends above allowance
- More tax-efficient than salary for profits above £12,570

### 3. Expense Management

**Improve Record Keeping:**
- Open dedicated business bank account (if not already done)
- Use business credit card for all business expenses
- Keep digital copies of all receipts
- Track mileage if using personal vehicle for deliveries
- Maintain log of home working hours

**Additional Expenses to Consider:**
- Professional indemnity insurance
- Mobile phone (business use portion)
- Training courses related to food hygiene or software development
- Domain names and web hosting
- Marketing and advertising
- Professional subscriptions

### 4. Capital Investment

If purchasing equipment or technology:

**Annual Investment Allowance (AIA):**
- 100% tax relief on qualifying capital expenditure
- Up to £1,000,000 per year
- Examples: commercial kitchen equipment, computers, servers, furniture

**Super-Deduction (if still available):**
- Enhanced relief on qualifying plant and machinery
- Check current rates with HMRC

### 5. R&D Tax Credits

**Potential for Future Claims:**

Your trading bot development may qualify for **R&D tax relief**:
- Enhanced deduction of 186% on qualifying R&D costs (SME scheme)
- Or payable tax credit of up to 10% if loss-making
- Applies to innovative software development
- Must be seeking technological advancement

**Qualifying Costs Could Include:**
- Staff costs (if you pay salaries)
- Software subscriptions used for development (TradingView data feeds)
- Cloud computing costs
- Subcontractor costs

**Recommendation:** When trading bot development scales up, engage an R&D tax specialist to assess eligibility.

### 6. VAT Registration

**Current Position:** Not required (turnover £34 well below £90,000 threshold)

**Future Consideration:**
- Mandatory if turnover exceeds £90,000
- Voluntary registration possible earlier
- Food delivery: Most food is zero-rated for VAT (beneficial)
- IT services: Standard rated at 20%
- Consider voluntary registration if buying significant VAT-able supplies

### 7. Year-End Tax Planning

**Before Each Year-End (31 March):**
- Review profit forecast
- Purchase needed equipment before year-end to claim capital allowances
- Consider timing of large expenses
- Pay bonuses/salaries before year-end if beneficial
- Review director's loan account position

### 8. Making Tax Digital (MTD)

**Future Requirement:**
- MTD for Corporation Tax being phased in
- Will require digital record-keeping
- Quarterly updates to HMRC
- Start using cloud accounting software now (FreeAgent, Xero, QuickBooks)
